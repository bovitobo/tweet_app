TODO:
    Write a Simple Twitter Service
    Twitter is a service that allows users to read and write tweets which are strings of text
    that are 140 characters or less in length. Tweets are written by users and can only be
    viewed by other users who follow the author.
    Use the Django REST Framework (or another framework of your choice) to set up a local
    API that provides functionality for users to do the following actions:
    ● Create an account
    ● Write a tweet
    ● Follow other users
    ● View a list of tweets written by the users they follow
    The service should be run locally and have API endpoints that satisfy the required
    functionality. Authorization can be basic password based. Please include tests and
    documentation, but don’t spend more than 2 hours on the assessment. It’s OK if the
    solution is incomplete; it only serves as a launching point for discussion.
    Please deliver your solution by providing a Github repository link.
